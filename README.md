This repo has been created to paste the project for the course of Mining Massive Datasets in Data Science. This project has been evaluated on this paper: Exploiting Music Play Sequence for Music Recommendation. https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2017/0511.pdf For this project has been used the repo of a user that implemented the code. You can find it on this link: https://github.com/kushmadlani/imf2vec . Here I showed my project and the work I've done on it.
